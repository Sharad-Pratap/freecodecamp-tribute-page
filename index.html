            <p>This amazing woman has played many roles in her life and has been acting for decades. She has been nominated and won <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Kathy_Bates" target="_blank">many awards</a> including the coveted Academy Awards "Best Actress"
                for her role in the horror movie "Misery". You can find her name and star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
            </p> 
            <p>In the movie "Titanic" she played the "unsinkable Molly Brown", but she is seemingly unsinkable in her own right. She has fought cancer and survived for years. Above and beyond that,
                she's become an <a href="http://www.futureofpersonalhealth.com/advocacy/kathy-bates-overcoming-ovarian-and-breast-cancer" target="_blank">outspoken advocate for cancer research and education</a>.
                In 2015, she was invited to be on <a href="https://www.themarysue.com/sdcc-2015-women-who-kick-ass/" target="_blank">Comic-Con's "Women Who Kick Ass" panel</a>. Maybe because she does.
            </p>
